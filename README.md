# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-SMTP-MAILING-PROTOCOL-AND-IMAP
Mails are most efficiently used these days for communication . This communication may be 
official or unofficial. Since this plays a major role in transferring data in the present world ,as 
the Students of computer science everyone has to realize the working of this so that they 
would be knowing what is there and happening behind the icons we are using.
In our present project we are going to send mails along with jpg and pdf from one mail 
account to other mail account using python code and a command line interface using SMTP 
protocol and we will be asking the executer whether he deeds to send another mail or he 
needs to retrieve the mails in his inbox and view them through IMAP protocol.
My project exactly mimic the present existing gmail app in features of security, reliability. 
This can even be used as an alternative for the mail app when it does not work due to some 
errors . 
From the projects like my present one we can know the back end programs behind the icons 
we are using on screen to just simply do our work .And I am sure that my project also will let 
you understand the mailing concept .
